      <p>I've been building stuff on the web for over 10 years. While I was in college studying graphic design, I taught myself to code and started building websites for freelance clients. By the time I earned my degree, I realized I was super passionate about writing code and creating on the web, so I started my career in web&nbsp;development.</p>

      <p>Here's what I've been up to since then, in resume-style reverse chronological order:</p>

      <h2>Music things</h2>
      <p>I've been playing guitar and writing, recording, and performing my own songs since I was a teenager. I released my debut solo album <span class="italic">It's a Wonder</span> in December of 2018 on streaming platforms and on vinyl.</p>

      <p>I still have a few copies of the album on vinyl. If you're interested in one, <a href="joshuamasen7@gmail.com">email me.</a></p>
