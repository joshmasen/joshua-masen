				<h2>Builder of the web</h2>
				<p>I've been building stuff on the web for over 10 years. While studying to obtain my Bachelor's Degree in graphic design, I taught myself to code and started building websites for freelance clients. By the time I earned my degree in 2010, there were far more entry-level development jobs than design jobs, so I started my professional career in development.</p>

				<p>Here's what I've been up to since then, in resume-style reverse chronological order:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="https://getflywheel.com/"><h3>Flywheel</h3></a>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<h4>Front-End Engineer (Product)</h3>
								<small>June 2019 - Present</small>
								<p>On the Product team at Flywheel I work on our hosting application built with Ruby on Rails. I'm responsible for the HTML, CSS, and JS, and I work closely with our designers and backend engineers to create delightful experiences for our customers.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h4>Front-End Engineer (Marketing)</h3>
								<small>May 2016 - June 2019</small>
								<p>As a Front-End Engineer on the Marketing team I was responsible for developing various Flywheel marketing sites, typically on WordPress. I worked closely with designers and content creators to rebuild our blog. I also acted as a technical resource for the team and integrated marketing and analytics software to help track and meet business goals.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h4><a href="https://interfaceschool.com">Interface</a> WordPress Course Instructor</h3>
								<small>April 2016 - June 2016</small>
								<p>As part of a partnership with Flywheel and Interface Web School, I instructed a class of students on the basics of web development, and introduced them to custom theme development in WordPress. Students developed real-world final projects for local non-profit businesses.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h4>Happiness Engineer</h3>
								<small>January 2014 - May 2016</small>
								<p>As the first full-time hire and first Happiness Engineer at Flywheel, my job was to understand our product deeply, sell it to new users, and support it for existing customers. I answered support requests via email and phone, and solved problems for customers related to WordPress and the Flywheel hosting product.</p>

				<h2>Musician</h2>
				<p>I've been playing guitar and writing, recording, and performing my own songs since I was a teenager. I released my debut solo album <span class="italic">It's a Wonder</span> in December of 2018 on streaming platforms and on vinyl.</p>

				<p>I still have a few copies of the album on vinyl. If you're interested in one, <a href="joshuamasen7@gmail.com">email me.</a></p>
